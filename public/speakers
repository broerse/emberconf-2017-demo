On top of that, we will go over the most common security issues in OAuth 2.0 implementations, and how you can mitigate them in your application.At the end of the workshop, attendees will understand what OAuth 2.0 is all about, and how they can integrate it using the Torii library. They’ll have a clear view on which OAuth 2.0 strategy (flow) to choose depending on the use case. On top of that, they will understand common security issues in OAuth 2.0 implementations, and how to effectively mitigate them.During the hands-on exercises, attendees will implement OAuth 2.0 support in a realistic training application. The exercises will be fully documented, and attendees will be able to use the provided application as a reference after the workshop.Ticket price of $299, space limited."

Each of these flows supports an explicit deployment scenario, and misusing these flows will likely cause your application to be vulnerable to various attacks.In this workshop, attendees will learn how to correctly implement OAuth 2.0 into Ember applications using ember-simple-auth and Torii. On top of that, we will go over the most common security issues in OAuth 2.0 implementations, and how you can mitigate them in your application.At the end of the workshop, attendees will understand what OAuth 2.0 is all about, and how they can integrate it using the Torii library. They’ll have a clear view on which OAuth 2.0 strategy (flow) to choose depending on the use case. On top of that, they will understand common security issues in OAuth 2.0 implementations, and how to effectively mitigate them.During the hands-on exercises, attendees will implement OAuth 2.0 support in a realistic training application. The exercises will be fully documented, and attendees will be able to use the provided application as a reference after the workshop.Ticket price of $299, space limited."
